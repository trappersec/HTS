This repo is dedicated to code for Hack This Site Challenges


This is a simple tool that I have developed while trying to solve Realistic Mission 6 on Hack This Site as well as learning Python. This tool has been designed to take an encrypted message and with little tweaks it gives you the secret message. 

1. One you get the encrypted message in your browser, you need to get rid of the dost and give it spaces : 

so instead of xx.xx.xx. -> xx, xx, xx, 

For that I have used http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/replace-text/ [online text replace editor]

2. For the next step you need to substitute your input for mine. Make you have to get rid of issues such as: xxx , xxx -> xxx, xxx (delete the extra spaces before the commas).

Following these steps got me to the result I needed, hopefully you will get it too.
